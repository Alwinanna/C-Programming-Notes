## 🔧 C Programming Projects Overview

### 1. 🧮 **Simple Calculator App**

* Performs basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* Demonstrates use of functions and `switch-case`
* Handles runtime errors like division by zero
* Input/output handling with `scanf` and `printf`

---

### 2. 📚 **Student Record Management System**

* Stores, retrieves, and updates student records using `struct`
* File handling (`fopen`, `fwrite`, `fread`) to store data persistently
* Menu-driven interface with options like **Add**, **View**, **Search**, **Update**
* Demonstrates understanding of data structures and modularity

---

### 3. ❓ **Quiz Game**

* Asks the user multiple-choice questions
* Tracks and displays score at the end
* Uses loops, conditionals, and arrays
* Introduces randomization for question order (optional)

---

### 4. 📊 **Marks Grading System**

* Accepts marks and calculates grades (`A`, `B`, etc.)
* Shows average, highest, lowest scores
* Introduces nested conditions and arrays
* Useful to demonstrate understanding of data logic

---

### Optional Extras:

* Makefile usage for compiling large projects
* Using header files (`.h`) and multiple `.c` files
* Documentation with comments and README files

---

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated

* Procedural programming
* Modular coding using functions
* File I/O and data persistence
* Handling user input and validations
* Working with arrays, strings, structures
